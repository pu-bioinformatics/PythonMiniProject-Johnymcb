# PythonMiniProject
PthonMini-project undertaken during my Msc in Bioinforamtics at Pwani University taught by Dr.Caleb
## File Structure
I designed six separate modules;the main module called Pdb_parser2.py that imports functions from the rest of the modules.
Each of the 5 modules is designed to solve a single function in the main module as reflected in the menu of the main module and or as highlighted in the project document(refer to attached PDF).

Function1 - PDB_verify2.py; validates pdb file and loads the file.
Function2 - SecondaryInfo.py; display amino acid sequence in pdb file per chain.
Function3 - AminoAcidHist2.py; display amino acids in the pdb file in histogram.
Function4 - SecStructure.py;display amino acid sequence in pdb file per chain plus symbols for helix and sheet.
Function5 - PdbFileExport2.py; exports the pdb file to another file.
Main      - Main module, runs the whole programm by importing functions from  the above modules.
